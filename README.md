TASK 1:
Creating a To-Do List Project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Building a To-Do List is an exciting project that showcases the power of web development. This project involves creating a digital task list where users can add, complete, and remove tasks. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. HTML Structure:
Start by crafting the fundamental structure of the To-Do List. Use HTML to create input fields for adding tasks, buttons for submitting tasks, and a container to display the tasks. HTML forms the backbone of the project, defining how elements are structured on the webpage.

2. Styling with CSS:
CSS plays a vital role in making the To-Do List visually appealing. You can customize the design by adding colors, fonts, and animations. CSS transforms the plain elements into an engaging and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

3. Interactive Functionality with JavaScript:
JavaScript breathes life into the To-Do List. Use JavaScript to create interactive elements such as:

Adding Tasks: Capture user input and dynamically generate new task elements on the webpage.

Marking Tasks as Completed: Implement functionality to indicate completed tasks. This could involve changing the style or adding a checkmark.

Deleting Tasks: Allow users to remove tasks from the list. Implement a mechanism to delete tasks when the user decides they no longer need them.

3.Responsive Design:
Make the To-Do List responsive using CSS media queries. Responsive design ensures that the To-Do List looks and functions well across various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

4. Testing and Debugging:
Thoroughly test your To-Do List on different browsers and devices to identify and fix any issues. Use browser developer tools to debug JavaScript and CSS, ensuring that your project works seamlessly.


5 Deployment:
Once your To-Do List is polished and functional, consider deploying it to a web server. This step allows you to share your project with others, demonstrating your skills and creativity as a web developer. I used Netlify for deployment.

Crafting an Elegant Calculator: Unleashing the Power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Imagine a sleek digital calculator at your fingertips, blending form and function seamlessly. With the harmony of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can bring this vision to life. Here's a glimpse into how you can create a user-friendly and visually appealing calculator application:

1. Intuitive User Interface:
Begin your journey by designing a clean and intuitive user interface. Choose a modern color palette and typography that enhance readability. Craft well-defined buttons and a responsive display, ensuring users can effortlessly input and view calculations.

2. Responsive Layout with CSS:
Utilize CSS to create a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes. Implement responsive design principles, ensuring your calculator remains functional and visually appealing on both desktops and mobile devices. Add subtle animations to enhance the user experience, making buttons respond interactively to clicks.

3. Dynamic Number Input:
Implement JavaScript functions to handle number inputs dynamically. Enable users to click or tap on buttons, displaying the input on the screen in real-time. Ensure smooth transitions between numbers and operators, creating a seamless input experience.

4. Arithmetic Operations:
Empower your calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations â€“ addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Implement JavaScript functions to process these operations accurately. Display results instantly, allowing users to see their calculations unfold in real-time.

5. Clear and Delete Functionality:
Incorporate clear and delete buttons for user convenience. The clear button resets the calculator to its initial state, while the delete button removes the last input or operation, enabling users to correct mistakes effortlessly.

8. Stylish Design and Theming:
Enhance the visual appeal with thoughtful design elements. Experiment with themes and styles to give your calculator a unique personality. Consider incorporating themes like dark mode for user preference and accessibility.
