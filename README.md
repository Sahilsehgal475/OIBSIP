Creating a To-Do List Project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Building a To-Do List is an exciting project that showcases the power of web development. This project involves creating a digital task list where users can add, complete, and remove tasks. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. HTML Structure:
Start by crafting the fundamental structure of the To-Do List. Use HTML to create input fields for adding tasks, buttons for submitting tasks, and a container to display the tasks. HTML forms the backbone of the project, defining how elements are structured on the webpage.

2. Styling with CSS:
CSS plays a vital role in making the To-Do List visually appealing. You can customize the design by adding colors, fonts, and animations. CSS transforms the plain elements into an engaging and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

3. Interactive Functionality with JavaScript:
JavaScript breathes life into the To-Do List. Use JavaScript to create interactive elements such as:

Adding Tasks: Capture user input and dynamically generate new task elements on the webpage.

Marking Tasks as Completed: Implement functionality to indicate completed tasks. This could involve changing the style or adding a checkmark.

Deleting Tasks: Allow users to remove tasks from the list. Implement a mechanism to delete tasks when the user decides they no longer need them.

3.Responsive Design:
Make the To-Do List responsive using CSS media queries. Responsive design ensures that the To-Do List looks and functions well across various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

4. Testing and Debugging:
Thoroughly test your To-Do List on different browsers and devices to identify and fix any issues. Use browser developer tools to debug JavaScript and CSS, ensuring that your project works seamlessly.

5 Deployment:
Once your To-Do List is polished and functional, consider deploying it to a web server. This step allows you to share your project with others, demonstrating your skills and creativity as a web developer. I used Netlify for deployment.
